This code assumes you have a CSV file named sample_data.csv with columns like 'Age' and 'Salary'. It reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, performs basic data analysis, and creates a scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between age and salary.


Make sure to have the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries installed before running the code:


pip install pandas matplotlib


Feel free to replace the file name and column names with your own data for testing.
